# Satellite orbit 
#### In this project I simulate the trajectory of a satellite that orbits the sun. The written report covers results, interpretation and illustrations. 



### Check out
* [Report](report_sheet1_orbit_WAGER.pdf) for more information on the computer experiment!
* [orbit.py](orbit.py) to view the source code


#### Program
orbit.py

#### Interpreter
Python 3.7

#### Usage
Adjust the simulation parameters in lines 50 to 61.
- Booleans: exclude each other and represent different experiments. 
- Variables: chose accuracy, simulation length and starting point
No user input in CLI necessary. All parameters are in the source code.
