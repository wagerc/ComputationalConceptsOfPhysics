# Pendulum 
__In this computer experiment a harmonically driven pendulum was simulated. 
Thus, both the bob and the pivot exhibit oscillatory motion. 
A simulation of their behavior was studied and visualized in a Python implementation.
The written report covers results, interpretation and illustrations.__
