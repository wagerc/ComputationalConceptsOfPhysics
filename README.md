# ComputationalConceptsOfPhysics
#### Simulations of physical objects and Machine Learning
The lecture covered basics methods and algorithms of computational physics from a multidisciplinary perspective, merging together fundamental physics, mathematics and computer sciences concepts (including machine learning) conveyed in the language of a natural scientist.<br>

The aim of this course was to teach students how to construct computer programs to carry out simulations and solve realistic problems.
